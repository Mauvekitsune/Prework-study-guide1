# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
-I started this project quite obviuosly for one because it was the first lesson provided in the course. However I started the class in order to expand my knwoledge of tech and the possibilities of a future in the tech field as well as to see if it peaks my interests.
- I built this proect in order to add notes on all four of the basic formats we will be covering in this project which are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git
-It got me started on the adventure of understanding the basics and premises of these formats
- I learned quite a bit in this project I learned how to push, pull, set up ssh keys, and jus the general idea of how Git and the gitflow works. I learned the basics of using html in both the header and the body and how to link both CSS and JS to it. I learned the basics of CSS and how to use the three different styles of CSS to link to HTML. I learned the very basics of Java and how to create basic functions and for loops.
